 3. Vanisher
 - Clears your bash history and truncates system logs.

 4. VPN Kill Switch
 - Monitors your VPN connection (tun0) and blocks internet access if it drops.

    vpn-kill
 (press CTRL+C to STOP; blocked internet remains until you run "sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT".)
 
 5. Automatic Proxy on/off

 ====================================================
     ALL SCRIPTS ARE LOCATED IN /usr/local/bin
 you can run them from anywhere by typing their name.
         
 USE ./ if the script files are not in /usr/local/bin
 example: ./vpn-kill
 ====================================================

P.S. If this was sent to you vie email or cloud etc...without archiving/it being zipped make sure before running the scripts that you make them executable via code:
 chmod +x ~Desktop/scripts/thescriptname
 example: chmod +x ~Desktop/scripts/vanisher
 this code works only if you put the file on your desktop but you get the jist of it.
