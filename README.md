script-list.txt - it has all the scripts, explanations on how to run them separately on your own if you dont want to use the toolkit menu for dummies

For DUMMIES you can use the ToolKit menu via code: ToolkitMenu
You're welcome xd

IF NOTHING IS WORKING!!!
you probably dont have the scripts executable
fix it by: sudo chmod +x scriptname

You can run any script globally by placing it in /usr/local/bin
sudo mv scriptname /usr/local/bin 
(In unga bunga language whatever directory you got lost in you can use those scripts freely by just typing their name)

- Tor must be running for proxy scripts to work.
